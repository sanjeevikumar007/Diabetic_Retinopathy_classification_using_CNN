**Diabetic Retinopathy Classification**
This project aims to develop a web application for the classification of diabetic retinopathy in retinal images. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if not detected and treated early. The goal of this project is to create an efficient machine learning model that can assist in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Utilized state-of-the-art CNN architectures, including AlexNet, DenseNet, VGG16, and ResNet50, to classify retinal images and predict the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy.
Web Application: Developed a user-friendly web interface using ReactJS, allowing users to upload retinal images and view classification results in real-time.
Model Integration: Integrated multiple deep learning models to enhance classification accuracy and robustness.
